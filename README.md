## Welcome to SepFree NMF!
This is our repository for the analysis of time-sequential spectra. 
We developed some scripts in Python language for the  Non-Negative Matrix Factorization without separability assumption (SepFree NMF).
In particular, we focus on estimating the minimal memory effect resulting from the application of the decomposition. 
To reproduce the figures of our paper, please look up the methanol tutorial and analysis. And of course, you can modify the tutorial to analyse in similar way your datasets. 

The language here is Python. 

### Important!
For the SepFree NMF algorithm to work, you should install the cmdtools package on your machine!
``pip install cmdtools´´
